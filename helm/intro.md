Welcom to Helm Chart lesson:

What is Helm?

Well, think of it as the apt-get / yum of Kubernetes, it's a package manager for Kubernetes developed by the guys from Deis (https://deis.com/).

If you deploy applications to Kubernetes, Helm makes it incredibly easy to version those deployments, package it, make a release of it, and deploy, delete, upgrade and even rollback those deployments as charts.

Charts being the terminology that helm use for package of configured Kubernetes resources.
